I started by following these instructions:
    https://medium.com/@ladyleet/building-your-first-react-native-app-4f21ced91064
Once done with this tutorial, I installed 'react-native-elements'

It should be noted that of the errors shown, when downloading a new library more often than not you must run this:
    rm -rf /tmp/haste-map-react-native-packager-*
If this does not work, run this:
     npm start -- --reset-cache
